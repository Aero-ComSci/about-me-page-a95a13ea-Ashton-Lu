<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>After 30 renditions, the numbers were still out of order. I still vividly remember my very first coding assignment, assigned by my parents as a passion project in 7th grade. I sat in front of my desk for hours, tortured trying to resolve a bug in my recursion. I am Ashton Lu, a sophomore attending Dublin High School and an aspiring programmer. Though I was first acquainted with engineering under a relatively apathetic temperament, it gradually secured a position of deep passion within my mind. Three years later, I am determined to major in engineering and obtain a job at Google. Though the competitiveness of this pursuit has been somewhat frightening, I now understand my more imminent goals. I plan to attend various hackathons, potentially with peers, and also finish the engineering track in Dublin High School.</p>
<p>My academic endeavors in Dublin High School have been mostly successful, with an unweighted grade point average of 4.0 and a weighted grade point average of 4.67. After a productive spring break, I even secured an SAT score of 1560. Yet, beneath this seemingly serendipitous first semester of sophomore year lies countless struggles. When my teacher for AP Calculus AB left on maternity leave, it was extremely difficult to adjust to the change in teaching style. Within two weeks, my entire class experienced substantial grade drops, and I was even marked off for obtaining a correct alternative answer on a quiz problem. I decided that during my first challenge of high school, I could not simply sit back and hope for the best. I organized a group of calculus students online and filed a joint student complaint to the school administrators with the signature of almost every single calculus student under the substitute's tutelage. The complaint contained a request for a curve on our latest test, along with a list of our substituteâ€™s inadequacies compiled with the combined research of my entire calculus class. I also informed the parents of my peers of this matter through email, and many parents complained individually. Over the course of the next three days, I had received private messages, emails, and suggestions on my email drafts from over thirty students, all of whom had gathered evidence regarding our teacher's ineptitude after hearing about my email. After less than a week of coordinated protesting, the school administrators had not only replaced our substitute teacher, but also substantially curved the test.</p>
<p>Though this experience was truly special as my proactive choices led to the benefit of the entire class, perhaps more memorable was my experience on the golf team in my freshman year. I did not expect to make it past tryouts, and even after I was accepted I worried that I would drag the team down. Until that point I was a complete individualist, never seeking help from others even in the face of the most insurmountable challenges. Yet, in the Varsity match against Granada and Poppy Ridge, the captain of the Junior Varsity team guided me through the course, intricately explaining to me the details of each hole and how I should play. It was a cooperative experience unlike anything I had seen in my middle school years, and in the following year it was me who proactively sought help from my peers. </p>
<p>It feels as if all my experiences in high school have been leading me toward my future. Never have I felt more prepared to take on the challenge of high school and college computer science as I do now, and I am convinced that I will only continue to get better. Thank you for reading about my high school experience, and you are welcome to learn more about me in the rest of this site.</p>
