<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<p>Welcome to my engineering profile! My name is Ashton Lu and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. During my time at Dublin High, I have taken many STEM courses such as CSE, AP Chemistry and AP Calculus AB, all of which I have a deep passion for. </p>
<p>In any organization, activity, or class, I strive to be as proactive as possible. When my Calculus teacher left on maternity leave, students in our class experienced a universal grade drop. I wrote an email to the school administrators detailing a list of complaints that were eventually resolved, which brought many struggling students to an A and allowed them to understand the pertinent concepts. In my career, I hope to find the confluence of engineering, political science, and activism, where I can apply my proactivity and passion for STEM.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at Dublin High, I have applied myself to several roles that I am passionate about. While I had long discovered my love for STEM by participating in math competitions, I believe that I excel the most when working as a team. As the vice president of the physics club and a member of the Dublin High Golf Team, I had worked in an abundance of collaborative and leadership settings. These endeavors have left me with unforgettable experiences that reinforced my belief that working cooperatively in the STEM field is the right path for me.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have demonstrated leadership, communication, and other skills, all fueled by a passion for computer science and STEM throughout my time at Dublin High School. I hope to bring these skills and experiences with my as I continue to explore the field of computer science. Thank you for your time!</p>
